# Module Challenge: Surfs Up

## Overview
An investor, W. Avy, wants to invest in a 'surf and shake' shop in Hawaii but needs to go through the logistics before opening said shop.

In this challenge, W. Avy wants the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.


##  Results
A set of temperature statistics from June:

A set of temperature statistis from December:
![December_temps.png](https://github.com/Paul-Lecander/surfs_up/blob/main/december_temps.png)

Key differences between the two data sets: 

- June is warmer than December, on average, by almost 4 degrees.
- December has a colder low temperature than June, with the low at 56 degrees.
- The June data set has more data points for temperature than December.

## Summary
Based on the information given, a surf and shake shop seems like a good investment for W. Avy based on the average temperature year-round.
If W. Avy wanted more information before investing, it would be wise that the following queries be performed:

- Precipitation for the months that were listed.
- Temperatures for all of the other months in case December wasn't the coldest month.
